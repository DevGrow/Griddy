Griddy is a small JQuery plugin thats creates a simple, customizable
grid overlay on top of any element. It can also calculate row heights
and column widths automatically based on the number of rows/columns 
and gutter space. Initially the plugin was pretty limited and did only
what I needed to, however after deciding to make it public I added a 
few options, including:

    * rows (#, default = 10, use 0 to disable)
    * rowheight (px, default = 0 [auto])
    * rowgutter (px, default = 20)
    * columns (#, default = 4, use 0 to disable)
    * columnwidth (px, default = 0 [auto])
    * columngutter (px, default = 20)
    * color (hex, default = #ccc)
    * opacity (0-100, default = 30)

The plugin is released under GPL, MIT and BSD licenses - free for any use!
